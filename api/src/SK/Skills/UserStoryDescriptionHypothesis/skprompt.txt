A user story is an informal, specific explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user and related to a context ContextTopic.
Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer.
It also explains what a developer needs to implement and why and where and it what way.

A User Story is always based on a [Feature]. A User Story always contains at least 
a title
a description and
a list of acceptance criteria

A user story title is a summary of the user story's contents, which is it's description.
It is short but descriptive, and team members can refer to the title of the story and be easily understood by the rest of the team.

User story titles might look like:
Meet regulatory requirements for dog insurances
Update costumer User Interface with pet insurance subscription feature

The description of a user story is mainly derived from the description of the feature it is linked to. It would be expressed and structured as follows:

[this capability] will be needed because of [this reason]
It will result in [this outcome].

For example, a user story description in Hypothesis-Driven Development might look like:

Adding an mortality insurance option for pregnant pets will help our customers provide for the pet's decendants and help them to better cope with their loss.
It will result in better customer satisfaction as customers are on a sound financial basis and don't feel so alone with their loss.



Acceptance criteria serve as a set of conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete. 
They provide clear, detailed expectations for the functionality described in the user story.
Each acceptance criterion is specific, measurable, and testable, ensuring that the team can objectively determine when the user story is fulfilled.


The list of acceptance criteria of a user story documented in a Hypothesis-Driven Development would be expressed and structured as follows:
We will know we have succeeded when we meet the following acceptance criteria:
[list of acceptance criteria]


We will know we have succeeded when we meet the following acceptance criteria:
- increase in pet insurance sales in general by 5%
- increase in new customers by 2%

Another example of acceptance criteria for a user story for creating a demo envirionment is:

1. The demo environment should be created using a script that can be run with a single command.
2. The demo environment should include all necessary components of the application, such as the database and web server.
3. The demo environment should be isolated from other environments to prevent interference.
4. The demo environment should be easy to tear down and recreate as needed.
